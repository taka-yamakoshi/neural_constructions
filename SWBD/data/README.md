`SWBD.csv` contains the original annotated corpus examples from Bresnan & Nikitina (2007).

`GeneratedSents_SWBD.csv` is created by the `GenerateSents.py` script,
which programmatically creates both DO and PD alternations of each
example in `SWBD.csv`, filling in subjects and using past tense for
uniformity.

`generated_sents_cleaned.csv` reflects the authors' manual correction
of errors, as well as removal of examples that are not actually to-datives
(as marked by Bresnan & Nikitina).
