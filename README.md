This repository contains code and data for "Investigating verb bias in neural language models", to appear in EMNLP.

Our analyses and predictions were pre-registered on the [OSF](https://osf.io/rtzv4).

* *DATIVE* contains our new dataset of 50K judgements, as well as code to reproduce our behavioral experiment and all analyses.
* *SWBD* contains materials for our re-analysis of the natural corpus of datives annotated by Bresnan & Nikitina (2007)
* *models* is a module used by our other analyses to extract sentence probabilities and hidden states from all neural language models we consider
